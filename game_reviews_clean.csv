The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,IGN,"Call us crazy, but when the final version of Zelda 64 arrived in the IGN64 offices, we stopped working, locked ourselves into a room with a big-screen TV and a surround system and played 17 hours straight. After only a few hours of sleep, we were back for more and we couldn't stop until we finished the game. Then, we started over again to find all the secrets.",100.0

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Game Critics,"High praise goes to them for also managing to fit joy, creativity and discovery into the game and doing so without the use of Full-Motion Video (FMV) and the CD soundtrack his critics said was needed.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Game Revolution,"The N64 is a 3D workhorse, and Zelda proves it with great textures, lighting, tons of little environmental effects, and smooooth framerates with no slowdown.

Grand Theft Auto IV,Official Xbox Magazine UK,"It's got a world you believe in, a cast you care about and a script stuffed with brilliant moments... Utterly stunning in every resepct. [May 2008, p.79]",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,IGN UK,"Expectations were so high for Grand Theft Auto IV that one of the biggest surprises is that it's managed to meet them. That it's also gone on to confound these is truly a marvel, and the game's Liberty City is nothing less than one of the greatest videogame worlds yet conceived.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,IGN,"I could go on and on about why Grand Theft Auto IV is one of the best games we've ever seen and why even folks who are easily offended should play it, but that would be pointless. The only thing you need to know is that you have to play this game. Period.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Eurogamer,"Almost everything you do in Liberty City would be good enough to drive its own game, and the best parts would be good enough to outrun the competition, but the reason it works so well is that Rockstar has made a game that requires no patience to play. This, as much as its usual coherency and the best script in the series, is what makes GTA IV the best openworld game yet, and why it will take something miraculous to rob it of game of the year status.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,1UP,"None of these little flaws take away from Liberty City's breathtaking vistas, incredibly varied scenery, and lived-in look (the PS3 version has the slightest visual edge, plus motion-control support -- but then it's missing Achievements and the eventual downloadable episodes exclusive to the 360 game). The city just feels alive.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,GameSpy,"The very nature of the American Dream is the central theme in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto IV, a gaming masterpiece that is a picture-perfect snapshot of the underworld of today's big cities. This is not only the finest title of the generation thus far, it is one of the best games of all-time.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,TeamXbox,"It's amazing that a sequel that keeps the core gameplay concepts of its prior incarnations can do so much to change itself into something new. Cabs are awesome, as is the cellphones capabilities. But perhaps the biggest innovation is the notion that you can create a game that's as valid a piece of art as any book or movie. Is this our ""Citizen Kane"" moment?",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,GameDaily,"Grand Theft Auto IV lives up to its grand expectations by weaving a Hollywood-ready ""American Dream"" plotline with a finely-tuned game experience -- taking the tried-and-true GTA formula and plugging it into a living, breathing version of Liberty City.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,GamePro,"Considering the fact that it's been a target of political and media pundits who keep harping on the infamous ""Hot Coffee"" incident, it's understandable to think that Rockstar might tone down the adult themes in GTA IV. But thankfully, that didn't happen. This is a mature game, and a devilishly good one at that.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Game Informer,"I now know how film critics felt after screening ""The Godfather."" It's been days since Grand Theft Auto IV's credits rolled, yet I can't seem to construct a coherent thought without my mind wandering off into a daydream about the game. I just want to drop everything in my life so I can play it again. Experience it again. Live it again...Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't just raise the bar for the storied franchise; it completely changes the landscape of gaming.",100.0

Grand Theft Auto IV,Gamer.nl,"GTA IV is the best action game ever. The game has beautiful details, nice situations, extrodinary gameplay, sharp humor and great graphics.

Grand Theft Auto IV,Total Video Games,"Smashing down the barriers between videogames and movies, GTA4 is what happens when flawless game design and ridiculously high production values collide.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,GameSpot,"A game that you simply have to play.

Grand Theft Auto IV,360 Gamer Magazine UK,"With so much to see and do that even months of play won’t cover it all and some of the tightest mechanics seen in a modern game, GTA IV is every bit as good as you could ask for it to be. You quite simply will not need another game this year.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,G4 TV,"The important thing is that after many years of frustrating missions, driving back home to save repeatedly, struggling with wonky physics, and dealing with farcical storylines, GTA IV has delivered a polished and almost fully renovated experience with a darker and more mature treatment of the subject matter.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Gameplanet,"In order to describe every little thing that you see in this game would require volumes. There is a staggering level of detail and for every detail we've mentioned so far, there are at least a dozen we've missed. Still, that's the beauty of Grand Theft Auto IV: the details will always be there for you to discover yourself.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Level7.nu,"Rockstar North has once again managed to elevate the GTA franchise to new levels of excellence. It's the best GTA experience to date, with a fantastic online mode to boot. Sure, this title does have its share of flaws, but when the game as a whole is nothing short of a masterpiece there is no reason as to why this game shouldn’t be a perfect ten.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Kombo,"In my opinion, Grand Theft Auto IV is the best game of this generation, thus far, and one of the best games ever made.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Totally360,"It's not merely the fact that Rockstar have taken an already engaging gameworld and rebuilt it from the ground up, it's the fact that they've done that, and shoehorned in realistic weather systems, day to night transitions, realtime lighting, realistic character movement and animation, realistic physics and kinetics, incidental details, solid and well written dialogue, convincing AI and non-player characters and a multiplayer system that puts other games to shame.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,PGNx Media,Grand Theft Auto IV is undoubtedly one of the strongest games of this generation. The amount of content is simply mind-blowing.,100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,X-ONE Magazine UK,"A fantastic, life-affirming piece of software that has set a new standard for what the medium can achieve, with a magnificent multiplayer mode to boot. If all games were this good, no one would ever leave the house. [Issue#33, p.84]",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Edge Magazine,"Yes, there's still the freedom to cause havoc, and inevitably you do; the difference is that you’re no longer impelled to toy with GTA IV's world in quite the same sadistic way - you live in it. [June 2008, p.82]",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,GamingExcellence,"GTA IV is the kind of title every gamer must have in their collection to justify their title as said gamer. It's near perfection in all areas, and in all honesty, I won't be reaching for my copy of GTA III anymore whenever I need my fix.",100.0

Grand Theft Auto IV,Jolt Online Gaming UK,"Grand Theft Auto IV is not a perfect game, but it is fantastic through and through, from start to finish and beyond.

Grand Theft Auto IV,Electronic Gaming Monthly,"GTA4 is a traditional crime story through and through, with a script that rarely strays from its purpose, a pitch-perfect supporting cast, and an expert combination of in-game storytelling and crafted cut-scenes. [June 2008, p.80]",100.0

Grand Theft Auto IV,Giant Bomb,"That psychological side to the game translates into characters talking about how they feel, and about what they're going through. It's extremely well-written and made a serious impact on me. This isn't the carefree killing-and-carjacking romp you might have expected.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Gamervision,"The game is fantastic, a true work of art, and should be owned by anyone who considers themselves a fan of video games. Grand Theft Auto does so many things right that calling it a ""sandbox"" title is doing it a harsh disservice. It does shooting better then many shooters, driving better then many racing games, and has a better, more involved story then half of the most popular RPGs.",100.0

Grand Theft Auto IV,Gaming Age,"There is one thing that did stand out at all times: the story, which is undeniably one of the most fun rides you'll ever have in gaming, and one of the most compelling cast of characters to go along with it.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Thunderbolt,"GTA IV may not have the best graphics, gunplay, A.I. or driving, but few other games have ever combined so many elements so successfully. It excels in creating a genuinely cinematic atmosphere, with writing on par with anything Hollywood can produce and action sequences that would sit comfortably in any movie.",100.0

Grand Theft Auto IV,GameShark,"With three massive areas and your hundreds of square miles of your own personal urban jungle, this Liberty City, more than any other version, is yours to do with as you please.

Grand Theft Auto IV,Maxi Consolas (Portugal),"Rockstar chose to cut off some of the features from the previous games, offering instead a much richer and cohesive world, with an amazing plot and even better cast.

Grand Theft Auto IV,ZTGD,"I could go on for another couple thousand words about the amazing experience that is GTA IV, but what's most important for you to know is that this game is an absolute masterpiece.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Kikizo,"At first, GTA IV was sort of feeling like a 9/10 game to me. There were a good few moments where I shook my head and jotted down another negative. But as the experience sank in, as the story captivated me, and as the pace quickened, I was very quickly humbled. It would be ridiculous to factor these minor gripes into even one point of a percentage in terms of scoring, because of the magnitude of the game as whole.",100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,BigPond GameArena,Ignore the score. This bears about as much comparison to the typical “10/10” game as black and white TV did to colour. What you want to be able to do is tell your kids fond stories of how you played GTA IV when it first came out.,100.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,Cynamite,This game is a masterpiece! We have never seen such a harmonic virtual world before. The story is as good as a movie and the graphics offer tons of incredible moments. GTA IV is more than a game.,100.0

Grand Theft Auto IV,GameTrailers,"Grand Theft Auto IV is the sex, drugs, and rock and roll of video games. It's a little less brave and intimidating this time around, but it’s also the most refined and polished game in the franchise’s history. This kind of sheen is generally reserved for titles with a much smaller scope.",98.0
Grand Theft Auto IV,IGN AU,"Without a doubt, rest assured this is the best game yet for this generation. The only reason we've resisted giving it full marks is that in the same way GTA III’s template was blown out so much further in ""Vice City"" and ""San Andreas,"" we're confident the next GTA on this generation will up the ante considerably.",98.0
